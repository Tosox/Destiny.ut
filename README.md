## FAQ

### Will the cheat be updated in the future?
- There will most likely be no new features introduced, 
but bug fixes and code improvements can be expected

## Known Issues
- The aimbot doesn't manage to aim on the target before firing
- The visibility check is unreliable
- There is a possibility that the cheat will not work immediately after new CS:GO
  updates because the offsets have not yet been updated
